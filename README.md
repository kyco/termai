### Configure OpenAI API

```                                                                                                                                                               
termai --chat-gpt-api-key YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### Or configure Claude API

```
termai --claude-api-key YOUR_CLAUDE_API_KEY
```

### Set your preferred provider

```                                                                                                                                                               
termai --provider claude  # or openapi
```

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Queries

```
# Ask a simple question
termai "What is the capital of France?"

# Get coding advice
termai "How do I implement binary search in Rust?"
```

### Using Local Context

```
# Create a README for your project
termai "Create a README for this project" .

# Generate tests for a specific file
termai "Write unit tests for this file" ./src/main.rs

# Provide explanations for complex code
termai "Explain what this function does" ./path/to/complex_code.rs
```

### Working with Git

### Generate a commit message from your changes

```
git diff | termai "Write a concise git commit message"
```

### Explain a complex git diff

```                                                                                                                                                               
git show | termai "Explain what changes were made in this commit"
```

### Session Management

### Start or continue a named session

```
termai --session my_project "Tell me about Rust's ownership model"
```

### List all saved sessions

```
