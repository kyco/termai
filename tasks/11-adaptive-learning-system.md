## Learning Algorithm Examples

### Preference Extraction
```rust
fn extract_communication_preference(interactions: &[Interaction]) -> CommunicationStyle {
    let detailed_responses = interactions.iter()
        .filter(|i| i.response_length > 500)
        .filter(|i| i.user_satisfaction > 0.8)
        .count();
        
    let concise_responses = interactions.iter()
        .filter(|i| i.response_length < 200)
        .filter(|i| i.user_satisfaction > 0.8)
        .count();
        
    if detailed_responses > concise_responses * 1.5 {
        CommunicationStyle::Detailed
    } else {
        CommunicationStyle::Concise
    }
}
```

### Smart Suggestions
```rust
fn generate_context_suggestions(
    current_directory: &Path,
    query: &str,
    user_patterns: &UsagePatterns
) -> Vec<ContextSuggestion> {
    let mut suggestions = Vec::new();
    
    // Learn from successful context patterns
    for pattern in &user_patterns.context_patterns {
        if pattern.directory_matches(current_directory) &&
           pattern.query_similarity(query) > 0.7 {
            suggestions.push(ContextSuggestion {
                files: pattern.successful_files.clone(),
                confidence: pattern.success_rate,
                reason: pattern.reasoning.clone(),
            });
        }
    }
    
    suggestions.sort_by(|a, b| b.confidence.partial_cmp(&a.confidence).unwrap());
    suggestions.truncate(3);
    suggestions
}
```

## Privacy and Security Features

### Data Anonymization
```rust
fn anonymize_usage_data(raw_data: &UsageData) -> AnonymizedData {
    AnonymizedData {
        patterns: extract_patterns_only(&raw_data),
        timestamps: hash_timestamps(&raw_data.timestamps),
        file_types: generalize_file_types(&raw_data.files),
        // Remove all personally identifiable information
        user_id: hash_user_id(&raw_data.user_id),
    }
}
```

### Local-Only Learning
```rust
struct LocalLearningEngine {
    model_path: PathBuf,
    encryption_key: Vec<u8>,
    never_sync: bool, // Ensure data never leaves machine
}

impl LocalLearningEngine {
    fn save_encrypted_model(&self, model: &LearningModel) -> Result<()> {
        let encrypted_data = encrypt(&serialize(model)?, &self.encryption_key)?;
        std::fs::write(&self.model_path, encrypted_data)?;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Success Metrics
- Personalization accuracy: >85% for suggestions and preferences
- Productivity improvement: >30% through adaptive features  
- User adoption: >60% enable learning features
- Suggestion acceptance: >40% of smart suggestions accepted
- Privacy compliance: 100% local-only data processing

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Privacy concerns about data collection
  - **Mitigation**: Local-only processing, transparent controls, user consent
- **Risk**: Learning system making incorrect assumptions
  - **Mitigation**: Confidence thresholds, easy reset options, explicit feedback
- **Risk**: Performance impact from learning overhead
  - **Mitigation**: Efficient algorithms, background processing, optional features**Note**: Backwards compatibility is explicitly not a concern for this implementation.
