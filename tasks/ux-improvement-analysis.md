    pub claude_api_key: Option<String>,
    pub system_prompt: Option<String>,
    // ... 20+ more fields
}

// Proposed: Hierarchical subcommands
#[derive(Subcommand)]
pub enum Commands {
    Setup(SetupArgs),
    Chat(ChatArgs),
    Session(SessionArgs),
    Config(ConfigArgs),
}
```

// New interactive REPL implementation
pub struct InteractiveSession {
    provider: Box<dyn LLMProvider>,
    session: Session,
    context: ProjectContext,
    commands: CommandRegistry,
}

impl InteractiveSession {
    pub async fn run(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
        // Main interaction loop with command parsing
    }
}
```

#### Context Intelligence Layer
```rust
// Smart context discovery and management
pub struct ContextManager {
    project_detector: ProjectDetector,
    file_analyzer: FileAnalyzer,
    token_optimizer: TokenOptimizer,
}

impl ContextManager {
    pub fn discover_context(&self, path: &Path) -> ProjectContext {
        // Intelligent context discovery
    }
}
```
