2. **Code Review Assistant** - Quality improvement feature  
3. **Git Hook Integration** - Automation and seamless experience
4. **Missing Workflow Features** - Complete existing functionality
5. **Advanced Git Features** - Nice-to-have enhancements
6. **Enhanced Configuration** - Edge case handling

## Success Metrics
- Commit message generation usage: >50% of commits
- Code review adoption: >30% of staged changes reviewed
- Hook installation rate: >25% of users
- Time saved on Git tasks: >20% reduction
- User satisfaction with Git integration: >4.0/5
- Reduction in commit message rewrites: >40%

## Integration with Existing Features
- Commit generation should work with existing repository detection
- Review functionality should use existing diff analysis
- Hooks should integrate with existing AI providers
- All features should follow existing CLI patterns and error handling

## Notes
- This builds on the solid foundation already implemented in Phase 1
- Focus on developer productivity and workflow enhancement
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing Git integration
- Consider this the completion of the original Git integration vision
