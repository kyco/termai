## File Changes Required

### New Files
- `src/git/mod.rs` - Git integration module
- `src/git/repository.rs` - Git repository operations
- `src/git/diff.rs` - Diff parsing and analysis
- `src/git/commit.rs` - Commit message generation

- `src/git/hooks.rs` - Git hook management

### Modified Files
- `src/main.rs` - Add Git subcommands
- `src/args.rs` - Add Git command arguments
- `Cargo.toml` - Add Git dependencies

## Dependencies to Add
```toml
[dependencies]
git2 = "0.18"          # Git operations
regex = "1.10"         # Pattern matching for diffs
tempfile = "3.8"       # Temporary file handling
```

## Command Examples

### Commit Message Generation
```bash
# Analyze staged changes and generate commit message
termai commit
> 📝 Analyzing staged changes...
> 
> Suggested commit message:
> feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration with token refresh
> 
> - Add OAuth2Provider trait implementation
> - Implement token refresh mechanism
> - Add comprehensive error handling
> - Update tests for new auth flow
> 
> [e]dit, [a]ccept, [r]egenerate, [c]ancel?

# Quick commit with auto-generated message
termai commit --auto
```

### Code Review
```bash
# Review staged changes
termai review
> 🔍 Reviewing staged changes...
> 
> ⚠️  Found potential issues:
> 
> src/auth.rs:42
> - Consider using `SecretString` instead of `String` for passwords
> - Missing error handling for network requests
> 
> src/auth.rs:58  
> - Function is getting complex (15+ lines), consider refactoring
> - Add documentation for public function
> 
> ✅ Positive findings:
> - Good test coverage for new functionality
> - Follows consistent error handling patterns
```

### Branch Analysis
```bash
# Get branch summary

```

## Success Metrics
- Commit message generation usage: >50% of commits
- Code review adoption: >30% of staged changes reviewed
- Time saved on Git tasks: >20% reduction
- User satisfaction with Git integration: >4.0/5
- Reduction in commit message rewrites: >40%

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Performance issues with large repositories
  - **Mitigation**: Implement diff size limits and incremental analysis
- **Risk**: Git hook conflicts with existing tools
  - **Mitigation**: Detect existing hooks and provide integration options
- **Risk**: Complex merge scenarios causing confusion
  - **Mitigation**: Focus on common cases first, add advanced features gradually**Note**: Backwards compatibility is explicitly not a concern for this implementation.
